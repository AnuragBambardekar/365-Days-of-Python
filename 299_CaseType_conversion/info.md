# Case Types
- snake case
- kebab case
- camel case
- pascal case

## Snake Case
- Snake case separates each word with an underscore character (_)
- Used for creating variable and method names
- good choice for naming files
- good choice for when working with databases
- When all letters are in the upper case then it is known as `Screaming Snake Case`
- Used for declaring constants.

Example: <br>
```py
number_of_donuts = 34
FAVE_PHRASE = "Hello World"
```
## Kebab Case
- separates each word with a dash character (-)
- will encounter kebab cases mostly in URL's

Example: <br>
```py
number-of-donuts = 34
fave-phrase = "Hello World"
```

## Camel Case
- start by making first word lowercase.
- then, you capitalize the first letter of each word that follows.
- capital letter appears at the start of the second word at each new subsequent word that follows it.

Example: <br>
```py
numberOfDonuts = 34
favePhrase = "Hello World"
```

## Pascal Case
- similar to camel case
- difference between the 2 is that pascal case requires the first letter of the first word to also be capitalized.

Example: <br>
```py
NumberOfDonuts = 34
FavePhrase = "Hello World"
```
