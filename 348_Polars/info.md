# Polars library

- Polars is a high-performance DataFrame library, designed to provide fast and efficient data processing capabilities.
- Inspired by the reigning pandas library, Polars take things to another level, offering a seamless experience for working with large datasets that might not fit into memory.

- Polars combines the flexibility and user-friendliness of Python with the speed and scalability of Rust, making it a compelling choice for a wide range of data processing tasks. 
- So, what makes Polars stand out among the crowd? There are many reasons, one of the most prominent being that Polars is **lightning fast**.

- The core of Polars is written in Rust, a language that operates at a low level with no external dependencies. 
- Rust is **memory-efficient** and gives you performance on par with C or C++, making it a great language to underpin a data analysis library. - Polars also ensures that you can utilize all available CPU cores in parallel, and it supports large datasets without requiring all data to be in memory.

## Polars Contexts and Expressions
Contexts and expressions are the core components of Polarsâ€™ unique data transformation syntax. Expressions refer to computations or transformations that are performed on data columns, and they allow you to apply various operations on the data to derive new results. Expressions include mathematical operations, aggregations, comparisons, string manipulations, and more.

A context refers to the specific environment or situation in which an expression is evaluated. In other words, a context is the fundamental action that you want to perform on your data. Polars has three main contexts:

Selection: Selecting columns from a DataFrame
Filtering: Reducing the DataFrame size by extracting rows that meet specified conditions
Groupby/aggregation: Computing summary statistics within subgroups of the data
