# About .ini files

A config.ini file, often referred to as an INI (Initialization) file, is a simple configuration file format used to store configuration settings and parameters for various software applications. INI files are plain text files that contain key-value pairs organized into sections, making it easy for humans to read and edit. They are commonly used for configuring settings in software applications, particularly on Windows systems, but are also used in some Linux and Unix environments.

The configparser module in Python is a built-in module that provides a way to read and write INI files. It allows you to easily work with INI files in your Python programs.

The configparser module provides a convenient way to manage configuration settings in Python programs. It abstracts the complexities of reading and writing INI files, making it easier for developers to work with configuration data. It's especially useful for applications that require user-configurable settings, such as desktop applications or server configurations.
