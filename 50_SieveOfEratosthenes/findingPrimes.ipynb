    "The Sieve of Eratosthenes is an ancient algorithm used for finding all prime numbers up to a specified limit. It was first described by the Greek mathematician Eratosthenes around 200 BC. The algorithm is based on the observation that all primes greater than 3 are of the form 6k Â± 1 for some integer k.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea of the Sieve of Eratosthenes is to generate a list of all numbers from 2 to the specified limit and then iteratively mark as composite (i.e. not prime) the multiples of each prime number. At the end of the process, the numbers that are still unmarked are the prime numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts by marking 2 as prime, and then repeatedly finding the next smallest prime and marking its multiples as composite. The algorithm stops when all the numbers up to the specified limit have been processed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Sieve of Eratosthenes is considered to be a very efficient way of finding all prime numbers up to a large limit, and is still widely used today for various applications in computer science and cryptography."
