# About pystray

PyStray is a Python library that allows you to create and control system tray (also known as notification area or taskbar notification area) icons for cross-platform desktop applications. These icons can be used to provide various functions and notifications to the user.

Some common uses of PyStray include:

- Creating Custom System Tray Icons: PyStray lets you create custom icons and display them in the system tray. These icons can represent your application or convey specific information to the user.

- Displaying Notifications: You can use PyStray to display notifications or messages to the user through the system tray. This can be useful for alerting users to events or updates within your application.

- Handling User Interactions: PyStray allows you to define actions or menus that appear when the user interacts with your system tray icon. For example, you can create context menus with options for your application.

- Monitoring Background Processes: You can use PyStray to create background processes that run in the system tray, performing tasks like checking for updates or monitoring system resources.
