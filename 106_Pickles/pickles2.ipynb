    "Caching: Pickling is useful for caching expensive computations. You can save the results of a computation to a file or database and then load it back into memory as needed, rather than re-computing it every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Messaging: Pickling is also useful for sending messages between processes or machines. You can serialize an object, send it over a network, and then de-serialize it on the receiving end.\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Persistence: Pickling is commonly used for saving and loading machine learning models in scikit-learn, TensorFlow, and PyTorch, so that they can be reused later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Configuration files: Pickling can be used to store configuration data for your application, allowing you to save and load the data easily."
