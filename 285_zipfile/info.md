# About zipfiles

ZIP is an archive file format that supports lossless data compression. By lossless compression, we mean that the compression algorithm allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. A ZIP file is a single file containing one or more compressed files, offering an ideal way to make large files smaller and keep related files together.

Why do we need ZIP files ?
- To reduce storage requirements
- To improve transfer speed over standard connections
