# SimPy

SimPy is a powerful tool for modeling and analyzing complex systems, such as manufacturing processes, transportation systems, and more. It allows you to gain insights into how different components interact and how changes in parameters can affect the overall system behavior.

- Processes: In SimPy, you model entities or processes that interact with each other. A process is defined as a Python generator function. Each process can create other processes and interact with shared resources.

- Events: Events are points in time where something significant happens in the simulation. Processes can yield to an event, causing the process to pause until that event occurs.

- Resources: SimPy provides mechanisms for modeling shared resources such as queues, servers, and more. Processes can request and release resources, and SimPy manages the allocation and scheduling of resources.

- Environment: The core of a SimPy simulation is the Environment. It manages the scheduling of events, processes, and resources. You create an instance of the Environment class to run your simulation.
