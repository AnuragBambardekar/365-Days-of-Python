# is vs '=='

The is operator is used to compare the identity of two objects, meaning it checks if two variables or expressions refer to the 
same memory location. 
It returns True if the objects have the same identity and False otherwise.

The == operator is used to compare the values of two variables or expressions to check if they are equal. 
It returns True if the values are equal, and False otherwise.

**In summary, == checks for value equality, and is checks for object identity.**

The is operator may appear to fail or behave unexpectedly in some situations because of Python's memory optimization for small integers and certain string literals. Python internally maintains a pool of small integers and commonly used string literals to save memory and improve performance. This process is known as "interning."

For small integers in the range [-5, 256], Python ensures that there is only one instance of each number, and all variables with the same value refer to the same memory location. This means that two variables containing the integer 42 will always have the same identity.

Similarly, Python interns certain string literals, meaning that if you have two string variables with the same value, they might share the same memory location. This is especially true for short strings or strings that Python considers "interned."

However, this memory optimization is an implementation detail, and it is not guaranteed to happen in all cases or in all Python implementations. Therefore, you should not rely on the is operator for comparing the values of variables, especially for small integers or string literals.
