# Three-card Monte 

Also known as Find the Lady and Three-card Trick â€“ is a confidence game in which the victims, or "marks", are tricked into betting a sum of money, on the assumption that they can find the "money card" among three face-down playing cards. It is very similar to the shell game except that cards are used instead of shells. ~[Wiki]
