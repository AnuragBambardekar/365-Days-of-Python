# Access Modifiers

In object-oriented programming, access specifiers (also known as access modifiers) determine the visibility and accessibility of class members (attributes and methods) from outside the class. Different programming languages have different access specifiers with varying levels of access control. Here's a breakdown of what each of these access specifiers means:

**Public:**

- Access: Public members are accessible from *anywhere* in the program, both within and outside the class.
- Usage: They are meant to be part of the class's public interface and are used to interact with the class from external code.
Purpose: Public members typically represent the behavior and attributes that are considered safe to be accessed and modified by external code.

**Private:**

- Access: Private members are only accessible within the *class* where they are defined.
- Usage: They are used to encapsulate the internal implementation details of the class and prevent direct external access.
Purpose: Private members hide the internal workings of the class from external code, promoting encapsulation and information hiding.

**Protected (not present in Python, present in some languages like C++ and Java):**

- Access: Protected members are accessible within the *class* where they are defined and within *subclasses* (derived classes) of the same class.
- Usage: They provide a level of access for subclasses without exposing the member to external code.
Purpose: Protected members are used when you want to share some implementation details with subclasses while still keeping them hidden from external code.
