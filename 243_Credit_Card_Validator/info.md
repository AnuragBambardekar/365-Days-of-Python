The Luhn checksum is a simple algorithm that can be used to verify the validity of a credit card number. The algorithm works by adding the digits of the credit card number together, alternately doubling the digits in the odd-numbered positions and adding those digits without doubling. The final digit is then subtracted from 10. If the remainder is 0, the credit card number is valid.
