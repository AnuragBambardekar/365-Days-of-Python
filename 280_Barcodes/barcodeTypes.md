Barcode Symbologies differ in qualities such as capacity and linearity, making some advantageous for particular uses and industries.

## Code 39

Code 39 is one of the oldest barcode types and is commonly used in electronics, healthcare, and government sectors. It is a linear 1D barcode that can represent alphanumeric characters from the entire 128 ASCII character set and can extend to any length, limited only by label size. However, if space constraints are a concern, Code 128 might be a more suitable choice

## Code 128

Derived from the ASCII 128 character set, is widely used in packaging and shipping applications worldwide. It offers an automatic switching feature that optimizes barcode length.

## Interleaved 2 of 5

Interleaved 2 of 5 is a numeric-only barcode frequently used in warehousing, distribution, and manufacturing. It encodes pairs of numbers, with every two digits forming one symbol. To make this format work, the number of digits used must be even, so a zero is often added at the end of an odd-numbered set.

## Universal Product Codes (UPC)

Universal Product Codes (UPC) are commonly found on retail products. They were originally designed for grocery stores to enable quick receipt printing and inventory tracking. Manufacturers receive a unique company number in addition to individual product numbers after obtaining a UPC.

## International Article Number (EAN)

International Article Number (EAN) is a superset of UPC and is specifically used by booksellers, libraries, universities, and wholesalers for book traceability. These 13-digit codes are generated from International Standard Book Numbers (ISBN) for each book, providing standardized identification of publishers.

## PDF417

PDF417 is a stacked, linear 2D barcode used in various identification applications, including driver's licenses. It is the preferred standard for USPS and the Department of Homeland Security due to its advanced capabilities, such as encoding links to multiple data files. However, it can be larger in size compared to other 2D barcodes like Datamatrix and QR Codes.

## Data Matrix

Data Matrix is one of the most common 2D barcodes, featuring a square shape that can encode vast amounts of information in a small space. It is popular in electronics manufacturing and healthcare due to its high storage capacity. 2D barcodes require advanced scanners, such as smartphones, to capture and translate the entire image at once, making them superior in terms of storage capacity compared to 1D barcodes.

## Quick Response (QR) Codes

Quick Response (QR) Codes are a recent trend in barcoding, gaining popularity as marketing tools to link to web-based information. While not as compact as Data Matrix, they are frequently used on advertising materials and storefronts, providing links to special promotions or product details.
