A Grammar of Graphics for Python: <br>
plotnine is an implementation of a grammar of graphics in Python based on ggplot2. The grammar allows you to compose plots by explicitly mapping variables in a dataframe to the visual objects that make up the plot.

## ggplot vs matplotlib

**ggplot**: ggplot follows the Grammar of Graphics philosophy, which means you build a plot by specifying data, aesthetics, and layers in a structured and declarative manner. It emphasizes a high-level, abstract representation of your plot.

**matplotlib**: matplotlib takes a more procedural approach where you create a figure and axes, then add elements to them one by one (e.g., lines, points, labels). It provides a lot of low-level control over every aspect of the plot.

**ggplot**: plotnine, the Python implementation of ggplot2, uses a syntax that resembles R's ggplot2. It uses + operators to add layers and customization.

**matplotlib**: matplotlib uses a more traditional imperative approach, with functions to control various aspects of the plot.

**ggplot**: ggplot is often considered more user-friendly and has a shallower learning curve for beginners because it abstracts many of the complex details of plotting.

**matplotlib**: matplotlib provides more fine-grained control but can be more complex and verbose, especially for complex visualizations.
