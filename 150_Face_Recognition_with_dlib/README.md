Steps to Install dlib: <br>
1. Make sure you have cmake, if not then: ```pip install cmake``` <br>
2. GO and download the wheels for dlib, I used python 3.7 so download wheels for the same version. <br>
3. Go to the download directory and run ```py -3.7 -m pip install dlib-19.22.99-cp37-cp37m-win_amd64.whl``` <br>
4. ```py -3.7 -m pip install face_recognition``` <br>
5. ```py -3.7 -m pip install opencv-python``` <br>
6. You are done, check if dlib is installed by running ```import dlib``` <br>
