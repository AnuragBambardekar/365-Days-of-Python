# Lazy Imports
## About
In Python, lazy imports are a technique used to defer the import of a module or package until it is actually needed by the program. This means that the module or package is not loaded into memory until it is actually used, which can help to improve the performance of the program by reducing the amount of memory that is used.

In a lazy import, the module or package is not imported at the beginning of the program. Instead, it is imported when a specific function or class within that module is first called or used. This allows the program to delay the loading of the module until it is actually needed, which can help to reduce the startup time of the program.

To implement lazy imports in Python, you can use the importlib module, which provides functions for dynamically importing modules at runtime. One way to implement a lazy import is to use the importlib.import_module() function to import the module when it is needed.
