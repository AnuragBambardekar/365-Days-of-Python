One of the main problems we face during web scraping, we get blocked from the website. We are trying to scrape by issuing too many requests. That's because we have one IP address, so if we use this and exceed the number of requests then the website temporarily stops you from making further requests.

Solution is to spread out the requests to mmultiple IP addresses.
